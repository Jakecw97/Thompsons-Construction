# Thompsons-Construction
Graph Theory Project 2019 -- Jake Warren -- G00349377
--------------------------------------------
A program to parse Regular Expressions into Non Finite Automata and also checks the NFA to see if it matches a String.
--------------------------------------------

The project is broken into 3 main parts,  <br/>Firstly the shunting yard algorithm, which is used to parse the regular expression into 
the stack and postfix notations so that it may be read. <br/>Secondly Thompson's Construction is used to convert the post fix notations into 
non deterministic finite automata.  <br/>Finally the "checker" and "match" classes are used to compare these NFA with a set of pre-set text strings.
          
How to Run
--------------------------------------------
1)Download/Clone the project to your desktop/desired folder.   
2)Make sure python is installed on the machine.   
3)Open a command prompt (Windows key + type "CMD").   
4)Navigate to the download folder e.g"cd Desktop".   
5)Once at the download folder type: "python ThompsonsConstruction.py".
