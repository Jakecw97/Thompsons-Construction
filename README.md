# Thompsons-Construction
Graph Theory Project 2019 -- Jake Warren -- G00349377
--------------------------------------------
A program to parse Regular Expressions into Non Finite Automata and also checks the NFA to see if it matches a String.
--------------------------------------------

The project is broken into 3 main parts,  Firstly the shunting yard algorithm, which is used to parse the regular expression into 
the stack and postfix notations so that it may be read.  Secondly Thompson's Construction is used to convert the post fix notations into 
non deterministic finite automata.  Finally the "checker" and "match" classes are used to compare these NFA with a set of pre-set text strings.
